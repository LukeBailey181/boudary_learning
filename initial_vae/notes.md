* Get 10 vaes,  1 for each digit of mnist (can look online pretrained ones
or a pretrained a single one). 

Look for an importance weighted autoencoder 

* Use them to get boundaries of each class of mnist.
* Train classifier on these boundaries, just like I did on 
previous experiment 

* Start with 2-digits of mnist before building up - 3 and 8 for 
example because they are difficult.
